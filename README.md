# Feature Deep Dev

A Claude Code skill family that orchestrates multi-phase feature development with independent evaluator agents at every phase. Built to prevent rushing to execution — each phase has deep-dive evaluation before the workflow proceeds.

## How It Works

![Feature Deep Dev Workflow](docs/workflow.svg?v=2)

## Installation

**Prerequisites:** [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) — install with `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`

The install script automatically installs the [Superpowers plugin](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-superpowers) if missing.

**One-liner** (installs into current project):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MichaelZuo-AI/Feature_Deep_Dev/main/install.sh | bash
```

**Or specify a target project:**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MichaelZuo-AI/Feature_Deep_Dev/main/install.sh | bash -s /path/to/your/project
```

**Or manual:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MichaelZuo-AI/Feature_Deep_Dev.git
cp -r Feature_Deep_Dev/.claude/skills/feature-deep-dev* /path/to/your/project/.claude/skills/
```

## Quick Start

1. Install:
   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MichaelZuo-AI/Feature_Deep_Dev/main/install.sh | bash
   ```
2. Open Claude Code in your project
3. Invoke `/feature-deep-dev`
4. Provide a feature name, one-pager, and optional Figma screenshots
5. The workflow guides you through each phase with human checkpoints

## Skills

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `/feature-deep-dev` | Orchestrator — manages lifecycle, state, worktrees, checkpoints |
| `/feature-deep-dev-clarify` | Phase 1 — one-pager + Figma → structured spec via question loop |
| `/feature-deep-dev-implement` | Phase 2 — plan → code → evaluator scoring gate (≥90%) |
| `/feature-deep-dev-qa` | Phase 3 — holistic QA → bug fix loop |
| `/feature-deep-dev-evaluate` | Standalone evaluator with adaptive scoring rubric |

## Key Features

- **PO Agent** — auto-answers clarifier questions from context, only escalates what it can't answer (business logic, security, scope decisions)
- **Adaptive Evaluator** — scores across 6 dimensions (spec compliance, code quality, test coverage, UI fidelity, error handling, integration safety) with weights adjusted by feature type
- **Parallel Features** — each feature gets its own git worktree and state, multiple features run independently
- **Resumable** — state persisted on disk, resume any feature across sessions with `/feature-deep-dev resume <name>`

## Architecture

Layers on top of existing [Superpowers](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-superpowers) skills:

- `brainstorming` — conversational style for Phase 1
- `writing-plans` — plan generation for Phase 2
- `subagent-driven-development` — task execution with per-task review
- `using-git-worktrees` — isolated workspaces per feature
- `finishing-a-development-branch` — merge/PR workflow

## State Management

Each feature creates its own state directory:

```
docs/superpowers/feature-deep-dev/<feature-name>/
├── state.json       # Current phase, worktree info, PO agent log
├── spec.md          # Output of Phase 1
├── plan.md          # Implementation plan
├── eval-round-N.md  # Evaluator reports
└── qa-report-N.md   # QA reports
```
